Pseudocode for the "Sample Script"

Open the files with GitHub repositories
Parse repository url - 
    see if a test folder exists
    if true
        then look for the presence of test mocks
        /pom.xml and look for the word "mock"
        
    else
        discard repo and move on
        


Notes:
When navigated to the test folder in a GitHub repo, the url is usually in the form https://github.com/[username]/[projectName]/tree/master/test
