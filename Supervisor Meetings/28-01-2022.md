# Individual Meeting
## Date: 28/01/2022
## Time: 11:00 - 11:30

## Goals achieved since last meeting

* Script for refining projects with multiple sub-projects complete and running.

## Meeting Notes

* Discussed with the supervisor that the script was taking too long to run due to Github api rate limit. Even authenticated users have max rate limit of 5000 requests per hour and due to recursively iterating through the directory tree, this limit is reached very easily. He said that I might need to parallel run the script to make it fast. It was discussed that I should aim to complete the script part by mid february.

## Goals for next meeting
Have the script running done and run the smell detector script on the sample.
