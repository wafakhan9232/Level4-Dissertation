# Group Meeting 
## Date: 01/11/2021
## Time: 10:00 - 10:30

## Goals achieved since last meeting

* Read the paper on sampling good GitHub repositories.
* Was not able to find the paper on mocking other mock objects.

## Meeting Notes

* Meeting started with supervisor asking students about goals achieved since last meeting. I mentioned that I read the paper on finding good GitHub repositories but was not able to find any on test mocks mocking other test mocks and asked if supervisor had any suggestions on the terms to use in order to find these. He suggested to use different terms like "doubling" and see if they help. We (students) also discussed our plans for next week and I asked him if according to him it is the right time to start the script part because that would take quite a long time to complete. It was agreed that I would try to find papers on test mocks mocking other test mocks and from next week I would start the script part.

## Goals for next meeting
Look at paper regarding mocks of other mocks and read high level summaries that would benefit the script part.
