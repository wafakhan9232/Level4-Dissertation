# Individual Meeting
## Date: 11/01/2022
## Time: 11:00 - 11:30

## Goals achieved since last meeting

* Completed the smell detector script

## Meeting Notes

* Had to get into the meeting as I was having the issue of not being able to run my code smell detector script on my samples because of their mixed folder structure. This was discussed with the supervisor and he said that we should not try to overcomplicate the smell script. In my sampling script I should first check how many of my sampled projects are composed of multiple sub-projects and if the number is very low than should simply discard them. Otherwise, I would look at the folder, check if they have src folder, pom.xml file then count them as a project and used these as a standalone project.

## Goals for next meeting
Modify the sampling script to account for projects containing sub projects.
