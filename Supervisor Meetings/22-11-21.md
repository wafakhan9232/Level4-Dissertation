# individual Meeting 
## Date: 22/11/2021
## Time: 10:00 - 10:30

## Goals achieved since last meeting

* Have been looking at confounding variables when sampling projects.

## Meeting Notes

* The meeting was relatively short as I was not feeling well. The main things discussed in the meetings were to sample large projects and due to storage constraints it would be good if I could find a way to shortlist repostories from their url without having them to download first. The script part is now slipt into two:  one script for sampling repostories and one for the actual analysis.

## Goals for next meeting
Keep making progress on the script part.
