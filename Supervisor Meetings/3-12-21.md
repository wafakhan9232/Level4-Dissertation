## Goals achieved since last meeting

* Written pseudocode for filtering GitHub repos based on their usage of mock objects.

## Meeting Notes

* The meeting started with the discussion of progress since last meeting. I discussed some of the challenges I was facing with finding whether a project used test mocks or not. The supervisor directed me towards a solution for this. The status report due by 17 december was then discussed followed by things to consider when writing the dissertation. I mentioned that I intend to start the disseration soon, preferably during the winter break period.

## Goals for next meeting
Have the script complete by next meeting.
