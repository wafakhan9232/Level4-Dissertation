# First Group Meeting

## Date: 29-09-2021
## Time: 11:00-12:00

## Goals achieved since last meeting

* Was asked to fill out the Role Perception Rating scale and a brief overview of what I think the project is.

## Meeting Notes

* Meeting started with a brief intro about each other. Supervisor then went over what I thought the project was about and what was involved.
* He explained the motivation behind the project, how doubling and mocking is used interchangeably in organisations and what tasks were involved.
* It was discussed that the project will start with a literature review of the topic, will then proceed to creating the how to guide and will involve creating a script that would analyse Open Source repositories to find traces of mocking hiding bad code smells.
* He explained that the how-to-guide can be as simple as explaining mocking and its challenges.

## Goals for next meeting

* Do research to understand what code smells are.
