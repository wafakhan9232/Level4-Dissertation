# Individual Meeting 
## Date: 17/12/2021
## Time: 11:00 - 11:30

## Goals achieved since last meeting
* Sampling script completed and repositories sampled.

## Meeting Notes
We discussed what was achieved since last meeting i-e managed to get the sampling script working and out of 10k repositories, sampled around 2k that make use of mocks. It was then discussed that I moved to the actual script now and for that I am using javalang at the moment. Have been messing around with it, using it I can easily spot mocks and am trying to figure out how to spot mocks of other mocks. Supervisor mentioned to consider that in java we also have spy which are higher level of mocks and need to consider them as well. He also mentioned that mocking as a bed smell can be as simple as a class mocking another class and things like these are what we are interested in.

Key points:
* Check how many classes are mocked in the setup test.
* Then count how many are mocked in the individual test and if individual test have more than one mocked classes then it suggests that there is a bad code smell as essentially a developer should only be mocking one class in a test. 


## Goals for next meeting
* aim to at least complete half of the script, get it working for one kind of bad smell.
