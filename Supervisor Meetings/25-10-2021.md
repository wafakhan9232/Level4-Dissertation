# Group Meeting 
## Date: 25/10/2021
## Time: 10:00 - 11:00

## Goals achieved since last meeting

* Researched papers and wrote a detailed paper summary to show the supervisor.

## Meeting Notes
Meeting started with supervisor asking each student what they have managed to achieve during the course of the week. Supervisor asked each student to at least have one individual meeting every 4 weeks. I showed my paper summary to the supervisor asking for feedback and what he suggested was that my summary was quite detailed and I should aim at writing one paragraph summary for each paper as it will help in understanding the paper when I look at it at a later stage.

## Goals for next meeting
It was agreed that I would shorten my paper summaries and show them to my supervisor in the next individual meeting.
